\format{
\code{data(randomREH)} will load a list containing following objects:
\describe{
   \item{\code{edgelist}}{a \code{data.frame} that contains the random sequence of events. Columns of the edgelist are:
           \describe{
               \item{\code{time}}{the timestamp indicating the time at which each event occurred;}
               \item{\code{actor1}}{the name of the actor that generated the relational event;}
               \item{\code{actor2}}{the name of the actor that received the relational event;}
               \item{\code{type}}{the type of the relational event.}
           }
    }
   \item{\code{actors}}{names of actors interacting in the dynamic network.}
   \item{\code{types}}{names of event types observed in the network and describing the sentiment of the interaction (\emph{conflict}, \emph{competition} and \emph{cooperation}).}
   \item{\code{origin}}{starting time point (\code{t_0}) prior to the first observed event (\code{t_1}), the class of this object must be the same as the one of the time column in the edgelist.}
   \item{\code{omit_dyad}}{a list where each element describes an alteration of the riskset which takes place at specific time points and for certain actors and/or types.
    }
}
}
\usage{
randomREH
}
\description{
A randomly generated sequence of relational events with 20 actors and 9915 events. Each event type is associated to one of the three following sentiments: \emph{conflict}, \emph{competition} and \emph{cooperation}.

# actors names

# looking into the first modification of the riskset: omit_dyad[[1]]

## the vector `time` specifies the time points when this exclusion takes place
